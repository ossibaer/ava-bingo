# Ava-Bingo
A discord bot for playing Bingo while running Avalonian Dungeons in Albion Online.

## How to play
1. Start a new session with `!start`.
2. Have all players join with `!join`. They will receive their bingo card as DM.
3. Someone (preferably the scout) can strike items from all cards with `!strike <item>`. The bingo cards of all players get updated automatically.
4. As soon as someone gets a bingo, they will be pinged on the server.
5. Players can leave the session with `!leave`.
6. You can close the session with `!stop`. This will throw out any remaining players.
